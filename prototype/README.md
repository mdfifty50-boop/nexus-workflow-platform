# 🎯 3D Office - CEO POV Prototype

**Built by BMAD Method to prove the vision is achievable!**

## What This Demonstrates:

✅ **First-Person CEO Perspective**
- You sit at your CEO desk
- Director (blue avatar) sits in front of you
- Supervisor (green avatar) sits to your side
- Natural office environment

✅ **3D Interaction**
- Mouse drag to look around your office
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Smooth 60fps rendering

✅ **Dual Interface (3D + 2D)**
- Click "2D Board View" button to toggle Kanban board
- See project tasks organized in columns
- Switch back to 3D office view anytime

✅ **Proof of Concept**
- Shows the vision is REAL
- Built with production tech stack (react-three-fiber)
- Ready to scale to full platform

## 🏗️ What You're Seeing:

### 3D Office View:
- **Your desk** (brown wood with monitor)
- **Director avatar** (blue, labeled "DIRECTOR") - Your orchestrator brain
- **Supervisor avatar** (green, labeled "SUPERVISOR") - Monitors your agents
- **Office floor** with grid
- **Walls** creating the office space

### 2D Board View:
- **4 Columns:** Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
- **Sample tasks** showing typical project workflow
- **Agent assignments** (who's working on what)
- **Priority levels** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Stats** (Total tasks, completion, agents working)

1. ✅ **3D office metaphor works** - Feels natural, not gimmicky
2. ✅ **CEO POV is immersive** - You ARE sitting at your desk
3. ✅ **Dual interface is seamless** - Easy toggle between 3D and 2D
4. ✅ **Tech stack is solid** - react-three-fiber performs beautifully
5. ✅ **Vision is achievable** - This CAN be built production-ready

## 🔮 Next Steps (If You Approve):

### What the Full Product Will Add:

1. **Natural Language Interaction**
   - Speak to Director: "I need a website for my restaurant"

   - See them "working" in real-time (typing animations)
   - Progress bars show task completion

3. **Cross-Platform**
   - Mobile version (touch controls, voice commands)
   - VS Code extension (panel in sidebar)
   - Desktop app (Electron)

4. **Smart Onboarding**
   - Questions to understand your expertise
   - Builds directive.md for personalization
   - Configures agents for your needs

5. **Full Feature Set**
   - Multiple projects (workspace management)
   - Notifications (task complete, budget alerts)
   - Settings (graphics quality, preferences)
   - Export/share capabilities
