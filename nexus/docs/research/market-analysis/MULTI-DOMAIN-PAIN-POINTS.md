# Multi-Domain Pain Points Research
## Beyond Automation Users: People Who Don't Know They Need Automation

**Research Date:** January 2026
**Purpose:** Identify workflow pain points across professions that could be solved by Nexus - regardless of whether they currently use automation tools

---

## EXECUTIVE INSIGHT

**The Untapped Market:** While Zapier/Make users complain about existing tools, there's a MUCH larger market of professionals drowning in manual work who:
1. Don't know automation exists
2. Think automation is "too technical" for them
3. Tried and gave up
4. Can't afford current solutions

**These people have REAL pain, documented below. Nexus can capture them with "describe what you want" simplicity.**
