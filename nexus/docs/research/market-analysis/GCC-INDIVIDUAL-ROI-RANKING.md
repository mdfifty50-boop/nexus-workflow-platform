## NEXUS QUESTIONNAIRE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For NON-AUTOMATION-AWARE Users (50x larger market):

**Don't ask:** "What automations do you use?"
**Ask instead:**

1. "What task do you dread doing every week?"
2. "What's eating 5+ hours of your time that doesn't make money?"
3. "What deadline keeps you up at night?"
4. "What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
5. "How many times did you forget to follow up with a client?"
6. "How much did late payments cost you last year?"

### Capture Pain Points by Role:

| Role | Key Question |
|------|-------------|
| Lawyer | "How many hours did you spend on admin instead of billing clients?" |
| Doctor | "How much paperwork keeps you from seeing more patients?" |
| SME Owner | "How much time do you spend on invoices and chasing payments?" |
| Recruiter | "How many hours to fill one position?" |
| Sales | "How many deals slipped because you forgot to follow up?" |
| Accountant | "How many hours before ZATCA deadline do you start panicking?" |
