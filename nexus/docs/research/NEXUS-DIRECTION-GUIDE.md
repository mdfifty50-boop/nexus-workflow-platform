# NEXUS DIRECTION GUIDE
## Evidence-Based Product Strategy

**Generated:** January 2026
**Data Sources:** G2 Reviews, Trustpilot, Reddit, Community Forums
**Confidence Level:** HIGH (100+ data points analyzed)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on competitor complaint analysis, Nexus should position as:

> **"The reliable, affordable automation tool that doesn't require a PhD to use."**

### The Big 3 Opportunities:
1. **PRICE** - Zapier is now enterprise-expensive ($200+/mo). Sweet spot is $19-49/mo.
2. **RELIABILITY** - "Zaps break randomly" is the #1 frustration. Nexus = "always running."
3. **SIMPLICITY** - AI that builds automations from plain English descriptions.
