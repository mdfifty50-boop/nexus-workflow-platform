# ZAPIER COMPLAINTS (Ranked by Frequency)

## 1. PRICING / EXPENSIVE (89+ mentions)
**Severity: CRITICAL**

> "The biggest downside is the cost. For a basic user like me, Zapier feels more expensive than it should be."

> "Over time, Zapier has gone from being the budget option to almost being the enterprise option for many companies."

> "The price. This tool is rather expensive once you start to scale."

> "Prices went up 200%... their competitors offer much lower prices and better functionality."

> "750 'zaps' is the extremely low limit. After that you get charged a PENALTY on top of every Zap that you run."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Position as affordable alternative. Clear, predictable pricing.

---

## 2. COMPLEXITY / LEARNING CURVE (71+ mentions)
**Severity: HIGH**

> "Handling more complex workflows—such as conditional branching or data transformations—still requires careful configuration and can feel limited."

> "Error messages, while helpful, are not always specific enough to pinpoint the exact cause."

> "The complexity of creating custom zaps can be overwhelming and time-consuming."

> "Users face a steep learning curve, desiring more beginner-friendly resources and clearer tutorials."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** AI that builds automations from plain English. No technical skills needed.

---

## 3. UNRELIABLE / ZAPS BREAK (36+ mentions)
**Severity: CRITICAL**

> "Users express frustration over unreliable zaps that stop working without notification, impacting workflow and client interactions."

> "During a demo with a major prospect, the entire platform failed, with constant errors."

> "Patchy, inconsistent, simple zaps either don't trigger at all, or trigger endless zaps at a time."

> "Zaps not triggering as they should."

> "Workflows break randomly and you don't know until damage is done."

> "We lost revenues because of the 2025-10-20 incident. Zapier was unavailable during all the day."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Reliability as core differentiator. "Automations that don't break."

---

## 4. LIMITED FEATURES / MISSING INTEGRATIONS (43+ mentions)
**Severity: MEDIUM**

> "Users find Zapier costly for limited features, often requiring additional tools for more complex tasks."

> "No direct MINDBODY integration required using Pipedream as a middleman, adding extra steps and complexity."

> "Missing integrations - had to use workarounds."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** AI finds workarounds automatically. Smarter integration suggestions.

---

## 5. POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT (35+ mentions)
**Severity: HIGH**

> "Users experience poor customer support, finding it hard to access and limited for complex issues."

> "Customer service has deteriorated sharply over the last several months."

> "There is absolutely NO customer support. They only provide an option to HIRE someone to help you."

> "Support takes forever to respond and doesn't help much."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** AI-powered support that actually helps. Fast response times.

---

## 6. REFUND / BILLING ISSUES
**Severity: HIGH (Trustpilot specific - 1.4/5 stars)**

> "If you sign up for a paid plan and have issues, they will NOT refund you any amount for any reason."

> "Can't get a refund when they auto charged me when I am not even using the service!"

> "Billing tricks where you get locked into expensive plans."

> "You're forced into a pro trial and can't downgrade for 14 days. This is to manipulate you."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Transparent billing. Easy cancellation. Money-back guarantee.

# MAKE.COM (INTEGROMAT) COMPLAINTS

## 1. UNEXPECTED COSTS / ACTION LIMITS
> "You need to keep an eye on the number of actions in each workflow—if left unchecked, API calls can add up."

> "A scenario unexpectedly consumed their entire startup plan quota in two days."

> "Users suggested a usage tracker or clearer alerts would make it even better."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Clear usage visibility. Alerts before limits hit.

---

## 2. POOR SUPPORT
> "After a scenario unexpectedly consumed their entire startup plan quota, requests for help were largely ignored."

> "Follow-ups went unanswered."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Support that responds.

---

## 3. ENTERPRISE SCALABILITY ISSUES
> "Diving too deeply into automation without a solid foundation results in constant tuning of scenarios and gradual loss of control."

> "This makes Make a very challenging option for large enterprises."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Better governance for growing teams.

---

## 4. NO TEST MODE
> "It can be disappointing that there's no proper test mode. A feature like that would make building and fine-tuning automations much easier."

**NEXUS OPPORTUNITY:** Built-in testing/preview before going live.

---

## 5. LEARNING CURVE
> "The learning curve is a bit steeper."

> "It offers fewer native integrations compared to Zapier."
