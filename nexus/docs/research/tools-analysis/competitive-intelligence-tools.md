2. **Review Aggregation & Analysis** - Mine app stores, G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
3. **Social Listening & Brand Monitoring** - Track social mentions, sentiment
4. **SEO/Market Intelligence** - Competitive analysis via search/traffic data

## OPPORTUNITY GAPS FOR IDEATION

Based on this research, here are the key gaps that Ideation could fill:

### 1. PRICE GAP
Most CI tools are $500-50,000/year. There's a massive gap for:
- Solo founders ($19-49/month)
- Small teams ($99-199/month)
- Bootstrapped startups

### 2. UNIFIED REVIEW MINING
No single tool does:
- App stores (iOS, Android)
- B2B reviews (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
- Social complaints (Reddit, Twitter, forums)
- Combined with AI insights

### 3. OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION (vs. just monitoring)
Most tools TRACK competitors. Few tools:
- Extract "I wish..." statements from reviews
- Identify feature gaps from complaints
- Surface unmet needs
- Generate product ideas from pain points

### 4. AI-NATIVE EXPERIENCE
Most tools have "AI features" bolted on. Few are:
- GPT-powered from the ground up
- Conversational interface
- Generate actionable insights (not just data)
- Help you DECIDE, not just inform

### 5. FOUNDER-FOCUSED WORKFLOW
Enterprise tools optimize for:
- Sales enablement (battlecards)
- Marketing (brand monitoring)
- PR (media tracking)

No tool optimizes for:
- Idea validation
- Finding opportunities
- Building product strategy
- Solo founder workflow

---

   - "Compare complaints: Asana vs Monday vs ClickUp"

4. **Affordable Pricing**
