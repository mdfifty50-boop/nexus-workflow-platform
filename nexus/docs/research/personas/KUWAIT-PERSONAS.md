## Overview

These personas were generated using Delve AI's audience persona feature, based on detailed target audience descriptions informed by our GCC market research (see `RESEARCH-VALIDATION-HARDENED.md` and `GCC-INDIVIDUAL-ROI-RANKING.md`).

**Key Insight:** All three personas describe pain in PERSONAL terms ("I waste time", "keeps me from patients", "chase invoices") - NOT in automation/technical terms. This validates our "non-automation-aware" market positioning.

## Cross-Persona Analysis

### Common Pain Themes
| Theme | Lawyer | Doctor | SME Owner |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Time wasted on admin** | 25+ hrs/week | Heavy load | Excessive time |
| **Chasing/following up** | Signatures, clients | Authorizations, claims | Invoices, payments |
| **Paperwork burden** | Documents, files | Insurance, records | Compliance, government |
| **Want to focus on** | Strategy, clients | Patients, parents | Deals, growth |
| **Communication tool** | (not specified) | WhatsApp | Banks, portals |

### Validated "Non-Automation" Language
None of these personas use words like:
- ❌ "workflow automation"
- ❌ "integration platform"
- ❌ "API connections"
- ❌ "Zapier alternative"

They ALL use:
- ✅ "chase" (signatures, invoices, authorizations)
- ✅ "paperwork" / "papers"
- ✅ "focus on [what matters]"
- ✅ "simple, reliable"
- ✅ "waste time"
