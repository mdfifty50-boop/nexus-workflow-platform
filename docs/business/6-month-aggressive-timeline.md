## Risk Mitigations

### Risk 1: Can't Get 10 Customers in 2 Months

**Prevention:**
- Start outreach Week 1, not Week 4
- Personal DMs, not mass campaigns
- Offer extended trials to first customers
- Lower price temporarily if needed (validate demand vs. price)

### Risk 2: Zapier Launches AI in Month 3

**Response:**
- Already have customers with switching costs
- Double down on agency replacement messaging (Zapier won't go there)
- Focus on simplicity (Zapier will add complexity)

### Risk 3: Churn Exceeds 10%

**Response:**
- Interview every churned customer
- Build "win-back" automation
- Identify and fix top 3 churn reasons
- Consider pivoting to higher-touch (more support)

---

## Decision Points Summary

| When | Decision | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Month 2** | Continue? | 10 customers | Pivot messaging or market |
| **Month 4** | Scale? | 50 customers, <5% churn | Iterate product |
| **Month 6** | Raise/Bootstrap? | 200 customers, $20K MRR | Evaluate continue/pause |

---

## Final Note: Speed Over Perfection

This timeline assumes aggressive execution:
- Ship imperfect features fast
- Learn from customers, not assumptions
- Fix bugs in production, not testing
- Manual first, automate later
- Founder does everything until it doesn't scale

The 6-month window is a RACE. Every week of delay is a week for competitors to catch up.

**The only way to lose is to move slowly.**
